One of the core principles of the lean startup methodology is that every startup should answer two questions: “Should this product be built?” and “Can we build a sustainable business around this set of products and services?”[[^1]]

In order to answer those questions while avoiding wasting development time, lean startup encourages the startup’s members to quickly build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), which will be then extended iteratively. An MVP allows for fast collection of feedback from early adopters. Following a process called Validated Learning, this feedback can be incorporated in the next iteration of the product: new features can be introduced, or the team can pivot and change the product’s focus.

We can think of agile development methodologies as a means of achieving this fast feedback loop: said methodologies focus precisely on quick development cycles. On the other hand, a concern that might arise regarding fast innovation and continuous changes of direction is the lack of code quality that might ensue. However, as mentioned by Alistair Cockburn[[^2]], agile methodologies take care of this aspect too: in each development cycle, developers are asked to also focus on refactoring their code in order to make the next iteration easier. This way one can be sure that not only the startup can change direction once they realise that something is not going to work, but also that they do not have to sacrifice the quality of the product in order to gain flexibility.

According to Eric Ries[[^3]] the definition of a startup is “a human institution designed to create new products and services under conditions of extreme uncertainty”. This definition could potentially be applied to big enterprises too. However, it is more difficult to employ lean principles in such enterprises, mostly because once you have a consolidated user base, convincing management to take on the big risks that are associated with innovation is not an easy task. Some enterprises have tried to counter this internal resistance to change by creating the role of an “intrapreneur”. An intrapreneur is an employee who is charged with the task of creating a startup-like team within a large corporation, with the aim of coming up with (and then managing) an innovative product.

Some companies have introduced the concept of “hack week”: a week, once a year, in which developers can drop all the non-critical projects they’re working on in order to “hack” together a prototype of a cool new product. If the managers think some of these products might have success, they might create new teams tasked with developing them further. While this might be a step towards a more lean approach for enterprises, as Trevor Owens mentions[[^4]], intrapreneurs might end up failing more often than not due to internal politics, or because they’re side-tracked into low-growth activities. One other big obstacle mentioned by Owens is that intrapreneurs are paid a salary, which takes away all the risk/reward mechanism that usually pushes entrepreneurs to dedicate all their efforts in the making of a successful product. However, this might be countered by offering either a significant bonus or a percentage of the profits to those intrapreneurs who are successful.
